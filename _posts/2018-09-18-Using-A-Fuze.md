In today's lesson, we were told that we were going to be using 'FUZE’ boxes, and that we had to connect them to the school monitors in pairs. My partner and I found it really easy to hook it up to the internet and the monitor, so we managed to get an early start on the work, which was to work on ‘FUZE BASIC’, a coding application that is on the FUZE system. 

To begin with, we had to make the program say 'Hello World' repeatedly. To do this we had to use the following code: 

Cycle

Print "Hello World";

Repeat

When ran, the program gave a simple 'Hello World' repeatedly until you pressed ‘esc’ (or ‘escape’). The next step was to add a ‘Wait’ line in between the 2nd & 3rd lines. So, depending on how long you wanted the gap between every print, you would put in ‘Wait (x)’ (x being the number of seconds you want in between each print). After that the code looked like this:

Cycle

Print "Hello World";

Wait (x)

Repeat

This would mean that that when you ran the program, 'Hello World' would be printed at a steady pace, meaning that it would not hurt you eyes any more. 

After that, the book with the instructions in showed us how to change the background and text colours. There were a select amount of colours (15 to be precise), and here is the code that would make you able to have a teal background with lime text:

Cycle

Paper= Teal

Ink= Lime

Print "Hello World";

Wait (x)

Repeat
