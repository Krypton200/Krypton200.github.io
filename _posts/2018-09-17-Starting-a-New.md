This week, we deleted our repositories from Year 7 and created a new blog, only this time it could be slightly different. This year we could choose any of the Jekyll templates that github provided. Some looked really good, but they had body codes like **Ruby**** **and **HTML**, which I wouldn't have understood as I was taught **style.scss** in Year 7, so (despite the fact that if I had chosen a template that was not **css**, it would have been quite a bit of fun learning to code using something else) I ended up choosing the same template as last year: barry-clark/jekyll-now.

In this blog I finally figured out how to create a box for these blogs to live in, and I also managed to give that box rounded corners. Here is the code the allowed me to accomplish this:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>.box{</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td> height: 90%;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td> width: 60%;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>.container {</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td> background-color: #57BC90;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td> border-radius: 10px;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td> margin: 0 auto;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td> max-width: 740px;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td> padding: 0 10px;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td> width: 100%;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td> opacity: 0.7;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>}</td>
  </tr>
</table>


 The code in this that allowed me to add in rounded corners is the "border-radius: 10px;". The px in this line of code represents the **pixels.**
