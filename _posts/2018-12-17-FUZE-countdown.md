In this lesson, the class was told to create a countdown using FUZE that said T-MINUS 10, 9, 8, etc, and my partner and I found this pretty easy. 

Most of the class prolonged their assessment through the lack of use of variables, which added at least half an hour of time onto it. Having seen this, my partner and I decided to use variables to reduce the amount of time and memory taken up by the code. The code included the following lines:

CYCLE

     Print

     Print "T-Minus = â€œ; Number;

     Number= Number - 1

     WAIT (1)

     Print

REPEAT UNTIL Number = 0

This simple piece of code allowed us to create a countdown in 10-15 minutes tops. The places in the code where it says Number are what made it so easy. You see, earlier in the code, we made a variable called Number in order to make the code shorter.

When ran, the program gave a simple countdown that afterwards (through extra input) exploded. You can see the code for this in the previous post.
